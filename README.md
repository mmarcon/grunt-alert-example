This repository contains an example Grunt-based project that shows how to use grunt-alert for Slack notifications when jshint fails.

It is possible to quickly test it on Jenkins with [this Vagrant Box](https://github.com/mmarcon/centos-node-jenkins). The `SLACK_HOOK` enviroment variable must be set in the Jenkins job.
